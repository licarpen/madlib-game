            It was a <span id = "adj1"></span> day in <span id = "place"></span>. It also happened to be the first day of school!  Going back after summer vacation is always <span id = "adj2"></span> as a teacher and you are definitely feeling <span id = "feeling1"></span>.  This year, you have  <span id = "number1"></span> hundred <span id = "animalPlural"></span> in your class.  You walk into the classroom and they are <span id = "verb"></span> and throwing <span id = "objectPlural"></span> around the room.  You even see <span id = "modernName"></span> sticking a <span id = "thing"></span> up his nose.  How are you ever going to calm them down and teach them <span id = "universitySubject"></span>?  You flicker the lights and the kids become quiet.  The <span id = "adj3"></span> one even looks you straight in the <span id = "bodyPart"></span> .  This is it; your time to shine.  Feeling <span id = "feeling2"></span>, you give it your best shot, yelling <q><span id = "quote"></span>.</q>.  The class errupts in laughter and chaos ensues.  <q>That's it! I've had enough.  This can't possible be worth <span id = "number2"></span> pennies per hour,</q> you sigh.  <q>I quit! I'd rather be a <span id = "occupation"></span> </q>
